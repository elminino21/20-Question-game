# 20-Question-game
## Application path for this project
1.  Ask if question is correct

2.  Get correct answer from user, if wrong

    a.  Confirm correct answer from on a dictionary
    
    b.  Show user definition to confirm answer.
    
    c. show hight rack picture from google images on the subject
    
3.  ID each question and tie it to it answer(somehow), After considering a dozen of so implementation bit is the best option by far, that is if yes, count 1 if not 0. I could use this method to get an address location where the answer is, possibly(?), it could be use to get the next question.
4. Application needs two databases: one for question,and another for answers. For simplicity sake, the bit will be put on a array for later calculation when all question as process 
    a. 1,048,576 is the number possible questions and answers 
5.	Get Ideas for question somehow( read documents, play games online(yay)). 

6. (for it to be future proof) Create GUI implementation where if the path is not found the user can select a set of related questions, so that the user can find add an answer. 

    a. Giving the ability to add questions might be a possibility, but and SUDO version might be necessary to ensure questions are related, and accurate.
